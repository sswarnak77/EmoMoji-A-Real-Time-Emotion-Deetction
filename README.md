What It Does
EmoMoji is a real time emotion analyzer that can be accessed through a webcam and outputs a live-recording graph that responds to the changes in facial expressions.

How I Built It
We Used two different Convolution Neural Network architectures like GoogleNet and VGGNet to train our deep learning model on FER2013 dataset from Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition Challenge.The deep learning model was trained on GPU enabled g2.2xlarge Deep Learning AMI virtual instance on AWS.
